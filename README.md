Draft registration web-app for Magic Drafts

This is the very first draft of the web-app

Following is the workflow

1. Signup users using facebook (widely used open auth, and can also link with the group I think)
2. Select the date of the draft and hit signup
3. Show up on Monday and play magic !

Backend - 

Everytime a user hits signup he will be assigned to an existing pod if there are any seats available. Once the pod limit hits (8 players)
the app will open up another pod.

This is to just organize things, and not necessarily the od that you will play in.

If you want to subit PR for this please let me know.
